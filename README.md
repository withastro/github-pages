# [Astro](https://astro.build) GitHub Pages Template

## 🤖 Automatic Deployment to GitHub Pages

This minimal Astro project template comes with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that automatically deploys your site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For more information, please see our complete deployment guide—[Deploy your Astro Site to GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
